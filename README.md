# Creativity In Vitro: A Living Codex

> *“What if thoughts could leave the body without passing through language?”*
> — Field note, Day 0

**Criatividade In Vitro** is not a blog. It is a *codex* — an experimental manuscript in motion.
Part lab notebook, part speculative ritual, this repository documents an ongoing artistic research residency (April–June 2025) by **Lina Lopes** and **Eduardo Padilha**.

Our investigation begins with a question: *Can imagination be read directly from the brain — before it becomes speech, drawing, or code?*
To explore this, we combine EEG sensors, machine learning, generative models, and open collaborations across art and neuroscience.

This codex is organized as a **living system**, populated by mad scientists, alchemists, stitchers, data creatures, and rituals of technological resurrection. You won’t find a linear narrative here. Instead, you’ll encounter fragments, field notes, digital organs, failed incantations, and pulses of discovery.

Welcome to the lab.
Welcome to the machine.
