        The first phase of <em>creativity in vitro</em> is supported by the CloudWalk Artistic Residency,
        allowing us to build a brain-to-image system based on Lina Lopes' EEG signals.
        This support enables us to train our mental model — a machine learning system shaped by an adult, thinking, dreaming brain.

      <p class="mt-4">
        <span class="bg-turquoise">The second phase, however, is even more ambitious.</span>
        It involves working with <strong>mini-brains</strong> — neural organoids cultivated from Lina’s own cells.
        These lab-grown brain fragments will be connected to the previously trained AI model and observed as they respond to stimuli.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cultivating these organoids is a complex biotechnological process: it requires lab-grade materials, advanced protocols,
        ethical oversight, scientific partnerships, and time. We are currently seeking support to make this speculative phase a reality.
