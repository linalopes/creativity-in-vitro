# What is *Creativity in vitro*?

Welcome to the Codex. This is not a static website. It’s a live lab, a stitched-together Frankenstein notebook, an archive of raw thoughts and radical procedures.
You might be here out of curiosity. Or urgency. Or by some strange algorithmic accident.
Whatever brought you, you’re part of the experiment now.

### In a hurry? Start here:
> **Creativity in vitro** is a brain-to-image experiment where imagination becomes visible — without ever being written or spoken.

---

### Curious? Here’s a bit more:
*Creativity in vitro* is an artistic research project by Lina Lopes and Eduardo Padilha.
In Phase 1, we use EEG sensors and machine learning to translate pure thought into visual images — bypassing language entirely. In Phase 2, we apply this trained model to neural organoids cultivated from the artist’s own cells.
What happens when imagination is transferred to a mini-brain in a Petri dish?
