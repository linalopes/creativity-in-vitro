# What is *Creativity in vitro*?

Welcome to the Codex. This is not a static website. It’s a live lab, a stitched-together Frankenstein notebook, an archive of raw thoughts and radical procedures.
You might be here out of curiosity. Or urgency. Or by some strange algorithmic accident.
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Whatever brought you, you’re part of the experiment now.</mark>

### In a hurry? Start here with our tweet:

> An AI trained not on your texts, but on your thoughts.

> _Creativity in vitro_ is a brain-to-image experiment where imagination becomes visible — without ever being written or spoken.

### Curious? Here’s a bit more:
*Creativity in vitro* is an experimental artistic research project by Lina Lopes and Eduardo Padilha that explores how imagination can be captured directly from brainwaves.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">In Phase 1, we use EEG sensors and machine learning to translate pure thought into visual images — bypassing language entirely. </mark> Using EEG sensors and machine learning, we’re building an interface where inner thoughts—like "red", "square", or "fluid"—can be translated into images, without the need for language.

In Phase 2, we will apply this trained model to neural organoids cultivated from the artist’s own cells. In its next phase, the project speculates on the possibility of lab-grown neurons from an artist generating visual ideas on their own.
