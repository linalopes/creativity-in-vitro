## The Project Creativity in Vitro

> *If a thought has never been verbalized, does it exist?*
> *What if imagination could be decodedâ€”without passing through language?*
> *Could neurons in a Petri dish dream in images?*

**Criatividade In Vitro** is a collaborative research project by **Lina Lopes** and **Eduardo Padilha**.
It investigates the poetic and technical possibility of translating pure imagination into visual form â€” through neural signals, generative AI, and speculative bio-art practices.

Developed during a three-month artistic residency, the project unfolds in two experimental phases:

---

### ðŸ§  Phase 1 â€“ Thoughts to Image

We collect brainwave data using EEG devices and train machine learning models to associate neural patterns with visual concepts.

Instead of traditional *text-to-image* generation, we explore a **thoughts-to-image** system â€” using brain signals as prompts for generative AI (such as Stable Diffusion).

Our dataset begins with descriptive mental keywords like *"red," "square,"* or *"fluid"*, and expands toward more abstract forms of internal imagery.

---

### ðŸ§« Phase 2 â€“ Artist in the Dish

The second phase dives into **speculative biology**.

Using lab-grown neural organoids, we explore whether in vitro neurons can respond to stimuli and express creative patterns â€” raising questions about cognition, imagination, and the minimal conditions required for art.

> *What does it mean to train a brain that has never lived?*

### What This Project Asks

- Can we externalize imagination without language?
- Is creativity a uniquely human capacity?
- What defines an artistic self when the brain is distributed across code or cells?
- Can we capture glimpses of thought in systems that never dreamed before?

This project is documented through the **Codex** â€” a hybrid digital notebook, lab log, and speculative archive. It includes experiments, diagrams, field notes, collaborations, and public rituals.

Our aesthetic is inspired by *grotesque science*, *Frankenstein notebooks*, and *poetic hacking*.
Expect mess. Expect questions.
**Expect imagination under the microscope.**

> AI is not just a tool here â€” it is our co-pilot in radical imagination.
