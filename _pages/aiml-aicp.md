This section showcases my explorations in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Creative Practices. Here, you will find a collection of experiments, projects, ideas, and speculative concepts that bridge art, technology, and data. From prototypes that uncover hidden patterns in datasets to creative documentation of AI-assisted workflows, each project reflects my approach to **AI as a co-pilot for radical imagination**. Whether delving into generative models, interactive installations, or narratives that challenge the boundaries of human-machine collaboration, this space captures my ongoing journey to integrate AI into artistic and innovative processes.
