<h5 class="mb-3">The Codex Creativity in Vitro</h5>

      <p>The <strong>Codex</strong> is more than a blog. It is a living, evolving manuscript.<br>
      It is the lab book, the dream journal, the autopsy report, and the resurrection table of a speculative experiment called <em>Creativity In Vitro</em>.</p>

      <p>Developed by <strong>Mad Scientists</strong> Lina Lopes and Eduardo Padilha, it explores the thin membrane between thought and form, between signal and symbol.</p>

      <h5 class="mt-5 mb-3">Inside the Codex you will find:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Notes from the <strong>Live Lab</strong>, where we tinker with EEG signals, datasets, neural networks, and creative feedback loops.</li>
        <li>Logs of machine learning experiments and sensor testing</li>
        <li>Documentation of the project’s theoretical backbone, found in the <strong>Cabinet of Curiosity</strong>.</li>
        <li>Diaries, diagrams, failures, sparks — stitched together across science, speculation, and embodiment.</li>
        <li>Contributions from <strong>Alchemists</strong> and <strong>Stitchers</strong> who join us along the way.</li>
        <li>Agendas and rituals: the <strong>Live Lab Agenda</strong>, the <strong>Bureau Agenda</strong>, and the <strong>Observatory Agenda</strong> — mapping time and conversation across the life of the project.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-4"><em>This is not a clean archive. This is not a finished work.</em><br>
      <strong>This is imagination under the microscope.</strong></p>
