## Unexpected Resonance

One of the most beautiful outcomes of the *CloudWalk Artistic Residency* has been the unexpected yet deeply <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">generative conversations with fellow residents and researchers.</mark> This entry is a celebration of one such encounter — a field ripple sparked by **Rodrigo Mota**, who joined our Codex not just as a peer, but as a catalyst of insight.

Rodrigo is a data scientist working at the frontier of AI-enabled psychiatry and neuroscience. In his own words, he is passionate about **inner worlds**, knowledge sharing, and entropy as a method. His presence in the group chat turned what was a casual tech inquiry into a mini crash-course in neural signal acquisition, full of nuance, care, and rich references.

## Key Inputs Rodrigo Brought

- He reminded us that several high-profile brain decoding papers we were referencing used **electrocorticography (ECoG)** — an invasive method requiring surgical implants, usually with epileptic patients. These systems offer high spatial resolution, but are **not accessible**, nor aligned with our DIY, artistic methodology.

- He also pointed out that even in **non-invasive EEG studies**, many use **128-channel systems**, such as NeuroScan, to boost spatial granularity.

- Rodrigo generously shared **multiple open-access papers** and even the links to request pretrained models and datasets:
  - [PLOS One EEG Study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0274847)
  - [Nature Visual Cortex Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-66228-1)
  - [Pretrained Model Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScg6JQxt9iXq2T0_N878yt1IFGpX4smRU5FcJt2cwsPTZn3Yg/viewform)

- And, most meaningfully, he **offered to connect us with Prof. Dr. João Ricardo Sato (UFABC)** — a researcher with access to higher-end EEG equipment and an open-door spirit aligned with the values of this project.

## What This Sparked for Us

These inputs shifted key aspects of our direction:

- We reaffirmed our commitment to **non-invasive**, artist-led experimentation, favoring EEG systems that align with radical accessibility.
- Our focus on **language-based imagination** (not image-based visual reconstruction) led us to rethink what **regions** we want to capture — areas such as **Broca, prefrontal, and temporal lobes**.
- We began comparing headsets like **OpenBCI (16 channels)** and **Emotiv Flex (32 channels)**, balancing resolution with openness.
- Most importantly: we understood that we’re not just decoding signals — we’re mapping **subjective cognition** into aesthetic form.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Rodrigo’s presence reminded us that collaboration doesn’t always look like a lab or a formal committee. </mark>Sometimes, it’s a well-placed message in a group chat that quietly rewires the architecture of your process.

##  Obrigada, Rodrigo

We’re grateful not only for the references, but for the generosity of your thinking. You’ve helped shape how we approach data, ethics, and method. And you’ve reminded us that **community is also infrastructure**.

From one creative system to another: thank you.
