When stepping into the field of neurotechnology, the first friction isn't the hardware—it’s the language. What is the vocabulary of this space? How does one learn to listen to a brain?

This week in _Creativity in Vitro_, I’ve been diving into a series of lectures by **The BCI Guys**, a duo committed to making brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) accessible through their free online course: _Foundations of Neurotechnology_. The playlist unfolds like a well-paced primer. Not a technical deep dive, but an orientation—a cartography of the field’s essential terms, metaphors, and ethical edges.

We start with the brain—of course. But not in the romantic sense. This is the brain as system: frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital. For our purposes in _Creativity in Vitro_, special attention is drawn to the **temporal** (auditory), **frontal** (speech), and **parietal** (language) regions. These mappings are not mere anatomy—they are design interfaces.

The course introduces the neuron as a spiky, whispering creature. Dendrites receive, axons transmit, and voltage thresholds are crossed like invisible doorways. A resting potential at -70mV. Depolarization begins at -55mV. These minute shifts are what BCIs try to hear, through methods like EEG—non-invasive, noisy, beautiful in its imperfection.

And it turns out, EEG wasn’t always so standardized. I learned about the 10–20 system, a now widely adopted spatial protocol that determines where to place electrodes on the scalp. This patterning is both cartographic and infrastructural—it ensures that when we say “Fp1,” we mean the same thing, across time and space.

But the course goes further. Into signal noise and band filters (goodbye, 50/60Hz hum), into frequency domains and time series, into the family of waves—delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma. Each with its own rhythm, its own behavioral implications. (Beta, for example, feels like focus; theta, a door to memory.)

There’s a brief but useful sketch of machine learning concepts. Enough to position BCI data not as static recordings, but as temporal patterns—highly contextual, incredibly messy, and ripe for interpretation.

Ethics is a throughline. If we can enhance cognition, who gets to decide what is optimal? If memory is modifiable, where does the self reside? The course nods to fiction—_Flowers for Algernon_, of course—and reality: current players like **OpenBCI**, the **BCI Society**, and **Neurotech Reports**. It draws lines between speculative futures and regulatory presents.

For me, the greatest strength of this course is in its transparency. It doesn't try to dazzle—it invites. It says: _here’s the terrain, here are the tools, here are the questions still open._

And that’s enough to begin.
