_aka: how to solder your way through bureaucracy and burn-out_

I asked OpenBCI to re-route the neural headset to Zürich. Spain had failed me. Swiss customs were gentler. More orderly. They send you a bill. You pay. No drama.

Sam (the kind soul behind OpenBCI emails) made it happen — FedEx Priority, tracking issued, a new promise on the way.

It was already two weeks late, but I adjusted. If it arrived by next Thursday, I could still save the month. I could still make data appear.  
And it _did_ arrive. On a Friday.

Except…

The delivery person refused to hand it over unless someone paid **in cash**.  
Cash. In 2025. For a scientific device.  
Paulo — who was kindly receiving it for me in Zürich — didn’t have cash on hand. No card reader, no link, no mobile option. Just: _no delivery_.

Back to the FedEx office it went.

So I bought a last-minute flight.  
Sunday to Zürich. Monday morning pickup. Monday return to Barcelona.

If I’m being honest, the flight + Swiss tax cost about the same as the import tax I would’ve paid in Spain. Poetic, really.

When I got to the FedEx desk, I paid the nearly **300 CHF** in bills. They handed me a box that felt like mythology. I had carried it for so long in emails and breath and complaint — and now it was finally here.

Then the second question hit me:  
**What about the gel?**

The EEG headset includes conductive gel for wet electrodes. It’s not TSA-friendly. So I ducked into a Zurich airport bathroom and began **scooping brain gel into cosmetic containers** from the airport supermarket.

The poetic turned absurd.

**Checkpoint: Nervous system in transit**

Hours early, I sat in the terminal with my laptop, the Cyton board, a fresh battery, and the dongle.

Ready.  
I plug it in.  
Nothing.

The board didn’t light up.  
No signal. No life.

I recharged the battery.  
Still nothing.

I flew back to Barcelona with a heavy box and a heavier head. Once home, I pulled out the multimeter: **the battery was dead**. Fully. Quietly. Irreversibly.

**New city, new soldering iron**

I found a tiny electronics shop in Barcelona. I bought a new battery.  
And for good measure: a set of air-powered backup cells.  
And… a soldering iron.

Because when I left Lucerne for Barcelona, I had told myself:  
> _This time I’m a real digital nomad. No need to carry tools._  

That was a lie.

Soon enough, I was soldering again.

**The board lives**

Once powered, the board lit up like a small miracle.  
The Cyton works. It speaks. The machine has a pulse.  
Now it’s time to learn its language.

But before that, I had to write this. Because at one point I truly believed that when I finally put this headset on, my brain would just show a flatline.  
That’s how deep the fatigue had reached.  
That’s how absurd and beautiful and tiring it is to try and build anything real in this world.

**Creativity in Vitro** continues.

Not because everything works —  
But because we learn to live in the debugging.
