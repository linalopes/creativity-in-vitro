In our latest session, we (Lina & Padilha) dove into the growing ecosystem of EEG data from our helmet experiments. The meeting served as both a checkpoint and a compass—looking at what we have, what needs to be cleaned, and what doors could be opened next.

## Data, Loops, and the Art of Cutting

Lina walked through the current status of data collection: 20 files spread across CSV and TXT formats, loaded with raw impedance values and neural readings. We're now facing the familiar terrain of data cleaning—removing looped sequences, trimming sentences, and prepping the files for machine-readable analysis. There's poetry in pattern, but also noise, and the task ahead is to distinguish the two.

## Events, Partnerships, and Invitations to the Future

Padilha flagged upcoming opportunities—most notably a workshop in Munich this June. Will might be a key figure here, not just as a collaborator, but as a potential ally for securing sponsorship or forging deeper partnerships. Brain Products remains an intriguing possibility, should the stars (and email threads) align.

We're also eyeing festivals and soft spaces of encounter, like the _Festival Futuros Possíveis_, as potential springboards for our next phases.

## Action Items

- [x] Check Will’s availability for future partnerships and funding possibilities. ✅ 2025-05-21
    
- [x] Follow up with João: share meeting highlights and align on next steps. ✅ 2025-05-22
    
- [ ] Schedule a follow-up meeting with João to map upcoming technical milestones.
    
- [x] Reconnect with Denise and the University of Bern to explore collaboration and sponsorship options. ✅ 2025-05-23

## Closing Thoughts

The session underlined how vital this in-between phase is: parsing what we’ve gathered, courting who might join us, and prepping our narrative to walk into new rooms. We’re navigating not just data structures, but social architectures that could fund and amplify what’s next.
