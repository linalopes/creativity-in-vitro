> _April bled into May and my brain still isn’t wired in._


I was supposed to receive the OpenBCI 16-channel headset on April 23rd. It was meant to be the spine of this phase of the experiment — the conductive bridge between my biology and the model’s logic. FedEx promised 3 days. My plan trusted them.

What I got instead was silence. Then a crack in the signal.

Spanish customs reached out, asked for a passport and a purpose — as if the purpose of brainwaves could be easily stated in bureaucratic forms. I sent everything back the same day. Then waited. Waited. Tracked. Refreshed.  
Nothing.

And then — just like that — the package was rerouted.  
Back to the U.S.  
No warning.  
No explanation.

Rumors say EEG devices fall under “medical equipment” here. That maybe there’s a hidden layer of regulation. But nothing official came. No letter. No fee. Just a return to sender.

And so here I am, in Barcelona, one hand in code and the other in dirt, but no signal between the two. No headset. No dataset.  
Only the architecture of the experiment waiting for a pulse.

## **Interruption as Method**

This was supposed to be the month when I’d begin collecting neural data. Feeding signals into the first layer of the model. Watching patterns emerge. Testing the temperature of embodied intelligence.  
Instead, I’ve been debugging logistics and writing emails in three languages to OpenBCI, FedEx, Spanish customs, and the ghost of bureaucracy.

I'm reaching out friends, companies and institutions in Barcelona. I don’t know if anyone reading this has a direct contact here with a owner of a neural helmet — but if you do, **now is the time to whisper it to the wind**. I just need a device for May. One month. One bridge.

## **So what now?**

I’ll wait for the package to return to the OpenBCI warehouse. Then redirect it to Zürich, where customs are more transparent, where I reside, where packages arrive with grace. If all goes well, I’ll hope to have it by **May 9th**, but who knows?!

But my project doesn’t wait. My curiosity doesn’t pause.

So I ask:

- Do you know someone who has a headset I could use in the meantime?
    
- Do you know someone inside a company or a lab with spares?
    
- Do you want to build something radical with me?
    

Send signals. Send bridges. Send words.  
The lab is open.  
Even without a headset, the mind keeps pulsing.
