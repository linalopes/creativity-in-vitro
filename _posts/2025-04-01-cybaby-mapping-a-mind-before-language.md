When my daughter was born I did a neural helmet proposal for newborns with a view of the generated data. I was afraid of the next step in my life, being a mom and tried to bring this to my comfort zone: a project in art and technology. In that time, Paloma Oliveira organized Hibrida: experimental prototyping of perception amplifiers. And, with the support of GIIP, an academic group at the University of the State of SÃ£o Paulo, I had the opportunity to perform with my baby (Diana was 2 months old). 

**CyBaby** was a project aimed at monitoring the electroencephalographic patterns (EEG) of a newborn. All of these data constitute a kind of brain signature. The purpose of CyBaby was to know the signature at the moment it is forming, examining and recording the first stimuli in the world, such as suckling, evacuating recognizing the face and sound of the father and mother's voice, looking and feeling textures, etc. 

**CyBaby** was a poetic experiment that transformed this data collection and recording into tangible material in a digital performance. It was a proposal for rudimentary transcoding of the thoughts of a newcomer to the world before he learns the language (s) of communication.
