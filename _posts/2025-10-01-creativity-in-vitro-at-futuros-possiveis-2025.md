>[!important] _Preparing a bio-interface for imagination_

_Note: This post (and the Codex) is written in English. The entire activation at the festival—workshop, conversations, and panel—will be held **in Portuguese**, in **Rio de Janeiro (BR)**._

## What we’re about to build

Can we craft a **bio-interface for imagination itself**—linking brain signals, lab-grown neural tissue, and machine learning so creative processes can be translated beyond the human body? That is the question animating Creativity in _vitro_, our ongoing art–science project.

We align with Futuros Possíveis by probing the relation between **body–brain, imagination, and machines**, and by proposing ways to re-enchant the future through situated experiments.

## Why now, why here

The festival’s theme invites us to stage **sensory, ethical, and speculative** encounters with data from the brain and with AI—treating language and imagination as technologies of re-enchantment.

Our project stands on two intertwined phases:

- **Phase 1 — Interface for Imagination.** We collect EEG data and train models to associate neural patterns with visual concepts—**thoughts-to-image**, not text-to-image—starting from mental instructions like “imagine the sun on your face” and expanding to internal imagery.
- **Phase 2 — _Artist in the Dish_.** We venture into speculative biology with **neural organoids**, asking whether lab-grown neurons can respond to stimuli and express creative patterns _in vitro_. What does it mean to “train a brain that has never lived”?

## What we will activate at the festival

### 1) Immersive experience + open talk

A dark room becomes a thinking surface: four worktables with artifacts from our process; a stained-glass panel of Petri dishes with brain-wave visualizations; projections and screens showing a short doc and generative images. Inside this living studio we’ll host an **open conversation** about method, ethics, and poetic outcomes.

**Why step inside:** enter our “brain-atelier-laboratory,” read with the body (not only the cortex), and trade ideas in a space where concepts are cultivated like neurons in culture media.

### 2) Co-creation studio: from memory to speculation

We begin with a **significant object**. Each participant traces its material story and keywords. Then we flip the premise: _what if this object were an interface to a living AI?_ We sketch speculative futures with quick drawings and **visual AI prototypes** (e.g., DALL·E), turning memories into radical fabulations about brain, body, and machine.

> **When & where:** **24 Oct, 10:00–12:00 — EDUCA FREIRE** (festival venue).  

### 3) Panel — _Mentes, Máquinas e Matéria_

What happens when artists, scientists, and technologies create together? We discuss brain signals, organoids, ML/AI, and the possibility of translating creative processes **before language**—opening questions on co-creation with living systems.

> **When & where:** **24 Oct, 14:00 — ARENA AUDITORIUM**.

**Why listen:** to see how art and science can be practiced beyond labs and galleries, as accessible, living processes—and how imagination itself can be treated as a design material.

## Agenda (at a glance)

- **24 Oct — 10:00–12:00** · _Co-creation studio_ (**Educa Freire**) — Neurodesign especulativo.
    
- **24 Oct — 14:00** · _Panel_ (**Arena Auditorium**) — _Mentes, Máquinas e Matéria_.
    
- **Immersive experience** running throughout the festival; **open talk** held inside the space. 

## Mad Scientists

**Lina Lopes & Eduardo Padilha.** Artists–researchers exploring whether creative processes can be **cultivated and translated** outside the human body, connecting EEG, neural organoids, and machine learning. Collaborations include **CloudWalk**, **University of Bern**, and researchers at **UFABC**.
