## The Codex is a Conversation

This Codex — strange, stitched, living — would not have taken its current form without the collaboration of **Lídia Ganhito**.  
Lídia is a long-time partner, a brilliant professor at the Department of Arts at UNESP (São Paulo), and a practitioner of many languages: design, pedagogy, visual thinking, process curation.  

Her ongoing work with **artist books** has been a key inspiration for how this project thinks of form as meaning — especially when the form must host complexity: disciplines, roles, phases, minds.

## Why We Needed a Codex

When Eduardo Padilha and I imagined *Creativity in vitro*, <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">we knew it wouldn’t be a single-track narrative.  </mark>
We were not just working with EEG data and neural nets — we were working with a growing, distributed mesh of:

- Mentors, consultants, scientists, artists  
- Experiment logs, diagrams, images, papers, talks  
- Questions, failures, field rituals, poetic provocations  

So the Codex was born not as a blog, not as a portfolio, but as a **navigation system**: a way to hold the chaos. A way for people to **arrive** and find a path through the living archive of this artistic-scientific experiment.

## Letters, Notebooks, Diagrams

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">In the age before “scientist” was a word, we had natural philosophers. They drew, annotated, dissected, described.</mark>  
Scientific illustration emerged as a form of **cognitive translation** — an effort to render the invisible visible.  
Artists and scientists wrote to one another — *Goethe*, for instance, exchanged letters with **Alexander von Humboldt**, blending poetry and empirical observation.  

They filled sketchbooks, not with finished works, but with the **trace of their gaze**.  
And now? We still draw. We still document. But the sketchbook has become digital.  
We now ask:  

> *How do we keep the spirit of the artist’s book — tactile, layered, intuitive — alive in a digital space?*

## Codex as Digital Alchemy

Together with Lídia, we asked:  
- What is the **aesthetic of process**?  
- How can we **signal complexity** without becoming unreadable?  
- What kind of language, color, metaphor, or mess reflects our hybrid work?

This Codex is the result of those conversations.  
It includes our glossary:  
- **Mad Scientists** (Lina & Padilha)  
- **Alchemists** (our mentors)  
- **Stitchers** (those who join and contribute)  
- The **Surgery Table** (our digital whiteboard, our Miro board)

## Not Meta Yet

This post is a seed — not yet the full tree of <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">the meta-design behind the Codex.</mark>  
That, dear reader, will have to wait for another field note.  
But for now, consider this an acknowledgment: that behind every chaotic archive, there is also a logic of care. 

> Our madness has a method

Thank you, Lídia, for helping us give shape to the formless.
