## A Navigation Tool

After mapping out what we mean when we say _BioArt_ — and recognizing that meanings shift depending on who is speaking, and from where — we began wondering: how is _BioArt_ actually spoken about globally?

Over the past year, we collected and indexed every mention of "bioart" that appeared in our Google Alerts. We built a collaborative dataset using a shared Google Spreadsheet, cleaned it, and began observing patterns. Who is talking about BioArt? In what context? And in what language?

But collecting isn’t enough. How do we **navigate** this complexity?

We’ve now created a digital cartography of this one-year dataset using **Svelte**, **D3**, **Mapbox**, and **GitHub Pages** — hosted [here](https://linalopes.github.io/bio-terms/). It’s a map, yes. But more than that, it’s a way to **visualize presence, frequency, and distribution** of a term that is both technical and poetic, academic and speculative.

This is not a definitive visualization. It is a **navigation tool** — an interface for asking questions.

For instance:

- Why does China have nearly **400 indexed posts**, many of them produced by a single media entity, writing regularly about “state-of-the-art” BioArt exhibitions?
    
- Why do the United States entries resonate more closely with the concept of BioArt that we, Lina & Padilha, feel aligned with?
    
- And how might this mapping help us ask: **when I say “I’m making a work of BioArt”, who hears that the way I mean it?**
    

We’re interested in **anchor points** — visual and semantic — that help humans navigate complexity. This tool invites you to explore where “bioart” is being said, and eventually, how it is being understood.

## Next steps?

We’re working on analyzing **semantic clusters** within the dataset, tagging and exploring _in what context_ the term “bioart” appears. Is it scientific? Artistic? Commercial? Political? Speculative?

And we're asking: how do we build better tools to feel our way through language that is alive?
