There’s something I rarely articulate, but maybe it’s time.

I was born with idiopathic scoliosis — 42 degrees. A curvature that shaped not only my spine, but also my childhood memories. I spent long periods in rooms filled with machines whose only purpose was to see _through_ me. X-rays. MRI. Electro-something—I forget the name. They would send tiny electric pulses through my body, mapping the nerves, tracking their stubborn, silent paths.

I think those machines were my first audience.  
They taught me how to be read without speaking.

So now, as I move towards creating images _with_ machines—towards using my body not as subject but as signal—I wonder:  
what happens when I no longer lay still to be seen,  
but instead, invite the machine to see _through_ my imagination?

There’s something deeply symbiotic in this gesture.  
I know these devices, their sounds and pulses.  
They once looked inside me.  
Now, I look back through them.

When I sit to write a concept for a grant proposal—or even this post—I realize I'm always translating. From sensation to sentence. From impulse to idea. I’m choreographing a transcription of the unsayable.

Large Language Models are trained on words, yes. But maybe what they’re really doing is extending the edges of imagination.  
They’re not replacing it. They’re co-piloting.

And in this strange co-piloting, I bring my own lineage:  
A background in theater, in dance, in cinema.  
A body that performed despite a bent spine.  
A storyteller’s instinct.

Design fiction, speculative futures, bio-art: they are not just genres to me. They are containers for impossible questions.  
Like: what does it mean to create _in vitro_ creativity?  
Can I sell my imagination?  
Can a Petri dish hold a fragment of my aesthetic intuition?

With _Creativity in Vitro_, I imagine cultivating mini-brains built from my own cells, exposed to my brainwave patterns.  
Trained, perhaps, to remember the images I once dreamed.  
Or the gestures I once improvised on stage.

I don’t believe intelligence lives solely in the brain.  
Nor do I think creativity can be boxed into computation.  
It lives in the skin, in the tremble, in the breath held before speaking.

So when I generate images today—via EEG, OpenBCI headsets, machine learning models—I look not for realism, but abstraction.  
Not clarity, but resonance.

I’m drawn to the visuals that resemble how a machine might dream us:  
MRI topographies, blurred data maps, diffuse abstractions echoing wet algorithms.  
I want to lean into that ambiguity.  
To make the brain _fill in the gaps_.

There’s a song I keep returning to: **Aquarela**, by Toquinho.  
A line from it stayed with me:  
_"Com cinco ou seis retas é fácil fazer um castelo..."_  
_"With five or six lines, it’s easy to build a castle..."_

That line is a _prompt_.  
A seed that triggers the imagination.  
I remember thinking as a child: _can you really make a castle with just a few lines?_  
Maybe you can.  
But it will be an _abstract_ castle.  
One that invites completion from the viewer. One that isn’t fully drawn, but fully felt.

That’s the kind of art I want to make:  
a castle from six brainwaves.  
a watercolor built from neural noise.  
an interface where others can touch and play and imagine through the signals I’ve recorded.

Not in real time, perhaps, but still alive.

A digital artist’s sketchbook.  
A scrolltelling interface.  
A 3D navigation of cognitive landscapes.  
A metaverse of untranslatable feelings.

Who do I think of, when I think of this?

Maybe not a _who_, but a _how_.

How to remember the machine that remembered me.  
How to draw with electricity.  
How to speak with the unspeakable.

How to make a body visible through the eyes of a system  
that never had a body to begin with.
