> “What does it mean to imagine with machines — or outside the body at all?”


This week’s Cerebral Sync delved into the intricate landscapes of neuroscience, both within Brazil and globally. In a room resonating with analog memories and digital aspirations, we navigated the intersections of biomedical engineering, signal processing, and the burgeoning field of "neuro-entrepreneurship".
