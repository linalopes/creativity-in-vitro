As the whole concept of *Creativity in vitro* (also) revolves around the figure of the brain, I thought it would be good to surf on the momentum we created and read a book that has been on my shelf for a few years now. 

The book by Brazilian neuroscientist [Suzana Herculano-Houzel](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/suzana-herculano) is Our Daily Brain: neuroscience discoveries about daily life. In 47 essays the scientist summarizes important discoveries in neuroscience, in a light and funny way (given that the very goal of the book is to reach the general public and raise interest about neuroscience). 

Though I have not yet finished reading the book at the time of writing these words, I’ve already come to learn several interesting facts about this fascinating organ, some of which I share with you below:

- Neurons make up only 2 to 10% of brain cells
    
- When Einstein died, his brain was removed during the autopsy and cut into 240 pieces
    
- The brain itself is not sensitive to anything, not touch, not pain (what reminds me of the [conversation we had with Marc Dusseiller](https://cinvitro.linalopes.info/posts/we-have-no-pain-in-the-brain/))
    
- In 96% of people, the ability for speech is located in the left side of the brain
    
- New neurons are in fact produced during life, disproving the long-standing belief that these cells do not replicate
    
- The reason why we cannot remember most of our dreams is the low amount of noradrenaline in the brain during sleep
    
- Ducks can sleep with only half their brains

I don’t know about you but to me these were quite interesting facts to learn!
Unfortunately, the book has not yet been translated to English (although [another book by her](https://direct.mit.edu/books/book/4069/The-Human-AdvantageA-New-Understanding-of-How-Our) is!)

Good reading!
